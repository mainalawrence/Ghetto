                    <p><b>
                    The Ghetto Gypsy began as a Hamilton, MT school bus during the 1980s.<br/><br/>
â€‹                    Years later, it fell into the hands of a talented group of Missoula artists who 
                    wanted to give it new life. Initially renovated and used as a private party vehicle in 
                    the deserts of Burning Man, the possibilities for the bus have grown.  Whether you want a
                     birthday night on the town, an outdoor graduation party, or an intimate evening of music and poetry,
                      this versatile vehicle can provide the atmosphere for a myriad of events.<br/><br/>
                    So much love and hard work has gone into the making of the Ghetto Gypsy, 
                    and the fun is just beginning. We look forward to the next unforgettable night.
